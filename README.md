# K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which
uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. While it can be
used for either regression or classification problems, it is typically used as a classification algorithm, working off
the assumption that similar points can be found near one another.
